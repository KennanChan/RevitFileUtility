# RevitFileUtility

A library for Revit developer to read some information about a revit file without using RevitAPI

##Usage

Initialize an object of RevitFile with the physical path of the revit file(*.rvt,*.rfa,*.rte,*.rft) and the BasicFileInfo property is for information about the file and the Thumbnail property is for the thumbnail image stored in the file

##Notice

This library is written with C# 6.0 which means Visual Studio 2015+ is recommended for compiling.

##Reference

This library is mostly inspired by the article of Jeremy Tammik(The Building Coder) posted on [thebuildingcoder.typepad.com](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/open-revit-ole-storage.html)
